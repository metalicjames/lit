[![Build Status](http://hubris.media.mit.edu:8080/job/lit-PR/badge/icon)](http://hubris.media.mit.edu:8080/job/lit-PR/)

Under development, not for use with real money.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

* make

* (Optional, Windows) a [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html) environment might make things easier for you.

* (Optional, for full test suite) Python 3 + `requests` library from PyPI

### Downloading

Just use Git to download the repo and then cd into it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mit-dci/lit
cd lit
```

### Installation

#### Linux, macOS, Cygwin, etc.

Go has its own build process and dependency management, but for Lit it's a
little more complicated, so we set up a Makefile to do most of the work for you.

To build Lit and Lit-AF, just use the following command.  You don't have to have
a `$GOPATH` set up in any particular way since we handle that for you.

```bash
make # or `make all`
```

This will also run the test suite.  Running `make test with-python=true` will
include the python tests (requires `bitcoind`) that do some heavier testing.

#### Windows

It's recommended to install Cygwin and follow those setup instructions.  Or just
download prebuilt binaries.

1. Make sure that your `%GOPATH%` environmental variable is set up correctly.

2. Download dependencies and then build with something like this:

```
go get -v ./...
cd %GOPATH%\src\github.com\mit-dci\lit
go build -v .
go build -v .\cmd\lit-af
```

### Running

The below command will run Lit on the Bitcoin testnet3.  You probably need to
have `bitcoind` running on your machine such that Lit can connect to it when do
you this.

(Note: Windows users can take off `./` but may need to change `lit` to `lit.exe`
in the second line.)

```bash
./lit --tn3=true
```

Run `./lit --tn3=true` to start Lit on the Bitcoin testnet3

The words `yup, yes, y, true, 1, ok, enable, on` can be used to specify that Lit
automatically connect to a set of populated seeds. It can also be replaced by
the address of the remote node you wish to connect to.

### Packaging

This is a separate thing, but you can make a archive package for distribution by
using this:

```
./build/releasebuild.sh <os> <arch>
```

and it'll be dropped into `build/_releasedir`.  It should support any OS that
Go and our dependencies support.  Just instead of `windows` use `win` and
instead of `368` use `i386`.

**ALSO:** You can also package for Linux, macOS, and Windows in both amd64 and
i386 by just running `make package`.  (Except macOS is only amd64.)

And running `./build/releasebuild.sh clean` will cleanup the dirs it generates.

## Using Lightning

Great! Now that you are all done setting up lit, you can
- read about the arguments for starting lit [here](#command-line-arguments)
- read about the folders for the code and what does what [here](#folders)
- head over to the [Walkthrough](./WALKTHROUGH.md) to create some lit nodes or
- check out how to [Contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Command line arguments

When starting lit, the following command line arguments are available.  The
following commands may also be specified in `lit.conf` which is automatically
generated on startup.

#### Connecting to networks

| --------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------| ------------- |
| `--tn3 <nodeHostName>`      | connect to `nodeHostName`, which is a bitcoin testnet3 node. | 18333         |
| `--reg <nodeHostName>`      | connect to `nodeHostName`, which is a bitcoin regtest node.  | 18444         |

### Hierarchy of packages

One instance of lit has one litNode (package qln).

LitNodes manage lndc connections to other litnodes, manage all channels, rpc listener, and the ln.db.  Litnodes then initialize and contol wallits.

A litNode can have multiple wallits; each must have different params.  For example, there can be a testnet3 wallit, and a regtest wallit.  Eventually it might make sense to support a root key per wallit, but right now the litNode gives a rootPrivkey to each wallet on startup.  Wallits each have a db file which tracks utxos, addresses, and outpoints to watch for the upper litNode.  Wallits do not directly do any network communication.  Instead, wallits have one or more chainhooks; a chainhook is an interface that talks to the blockchain.

One package that implements the chainhook interface is uspv.  Uspv deals with headers, wire messages to fullnodes, filters, and all the other mess that is contemporary SPV.

(in theory it shouldn't be too hard to write a package that implements the chainhook interface and talks to some block explorer.  Maybe if you ran your own explorer and authed and stuff that'd be OK.)
